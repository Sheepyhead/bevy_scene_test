# Bevy scene test

This repository presents a method of spawning whole multi-object textured scenes with bevy, 
and applying components to them based on their names. The scene has been made with Blender 
and the process imports both camera and light from the exported GLTF file. The code should
require little explanation but feel free to ask questions in issues or at Sheepyhead#8008 
on the Bevy discord :)
